## ✅ **VERDICT: MVP PAGES 75% COMPLETE**

**The Klynaa platform has most essential pages implemented with high quality. The missing pages are important but not blocking core functionality since the HTML web app provides complete alternative access to all features.**

**Most critical gap**: Legal compliance pages (Terms/Privacy) and Contact page for customer support.

**Strength**: Excellent coverage of core business functionality with multiple implementation approaches (Next.js + HTML backup).
