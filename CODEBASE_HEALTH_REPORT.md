---

## 🚀 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Frontend Optimization**: Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` components
2. **React Hooks**: Fix missing dependency in useEffect hook
3. **Blockchain Security**: Run `npm audit fix` to address low-severity vulnerabilities

### Medium Priority  
1. **Network Dependencies**: Consider caching Solidity compiler for offline blockchain testing
2. **Test Coverage**: Add integration tests for mobile and serverless components
3. **Documentation**: Update paths in documentation to reflect current structure

### Low Priority
1. **TypeScript**: Consider updating ESLint configuration for newer TypeScript versions  
2. **Performance**: Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
3. **Security**: Implement additional security headers and validation
